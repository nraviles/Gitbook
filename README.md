# Introduction:

This site is intended to document and facilitate a Math Reading Group for participants from or affiliated with Fat Tony's Discord.

The goal is to foster continued learning and inquiry as it relates to Mathematics, both practical and otherwise, and to incite real interest and discussion rather than note-taking and "knowing" as passes in a regular classroom setting. As such it will expect participants not to know everything or even want to learn everything which is presented, but to ask questions.&#x20;

Presentations will attempt to provide resources related to the material so questions beyond it's scope can be addressed.
